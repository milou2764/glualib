--- 
--- This is used not just by entities, but also by widgets, panels, drive modes, weapons and gamemodes (with "gamemode_" prefix).

--- 
--- ```
--- local BaseClass = baseclass.Get
--- ```
---@param name string The child class. 
---@return table
function baseclass.Get( name ) end
--- Add a new base class that can be derived by others. This is done automatically for:
--- * widgets
--- * panels
--- * drive modes
--- * entities
--- * weapons
--- * gamemodes (with prefix "gamemode_")
---@param name string The name of this base class. Must be completely unique. 
---@param tab table The base class. 
function baseclass.Set( name, tab ) end
