---@class LocalLight
---@field type number The type of the light source, see [MATERIAL_LIGHT](/gmod/Enums/MATERIAL_LIGHT). 
---@field color Vector The color of the light source (x is red, y is green, z is blue). Values are not restricted to a specific range, higher values will result in a brighter light. 
---@field pos Vector The origin of the light in world coordinates. 
---@field dir Vector The direction of the light. Only required for directional and spot lights. 
---@field range number The maximum range of the light source. Does not actually control light attenuation. Usually left at 0 for infinite range. 
---@field angularFalloff number Angular falloff exponent for spot lights. Higher values result in a sharper transition between the inner cone and the outer cone. 
---@field innerAngle number The inner cone angle for spot lights, in degrees. No angular falloff will occur inside that cone. 
---@field outerAngle number The outer cone angle for spot lights, in degrees. 
---@field fiftyPercentDistance number The distance at which the light will fade to 50% of its brightness. 
---@field zeroPercentDistance number The distance at which the light will completely fade out. 
---@field quadraticFalloff number The quadratic term of the light falloff. This will only be used if fiftyPercentDistance and zeroPercentDistance are not supplied, and allows finer control over light attenuation. 
---@field linearFalloff number The linear term of the light falloff. This will only be used if fiftyPercentDistance and zeroPercentDistance are not supplied, and allows finer control over light attenuation. 
---@field constantFalloff number The constant term of the light falloff. This will only be used if fiftyPercentDistance and zeroPercentDistance are not supplied, and allows finer control over light attenuation.
